		<h2>The Gun Joke</h2>
		  <h3>by Jamaal May</h3>
			  <ul>
				  <li>It’s funny, she says, how many people are shocked</li>
				  <li>by this shooting and the next and next and the next.</li>
				  <li>She doesn’t mean funny as in funny, but funny/li>
				  <li>as in blood soup tastes funny when you stir in soil.</li>
				  <li>Stop me if you haven’t heard this one:</li>
				  <li>A young man/old man/teenage boy walks into</li>
				  <li>an office/theater/daycare/club and empties</li>
				  <li>Ever hear the one about the shotgun? What do you call it</li>
				  <li>when a shotgun tests a liquor store’s bulletproof glass?</li>
				  <li>What’s the difference between a teenager</li>
				  <li>with hands in the air and a paper target charging at a cop?</li>
				  <li>What do you call it when a man sets his own house on fire,</li>
				  <li>Stop me if you haven’t heard this one:</li>
				  <li>The first man to pull a gun on me said it was only a joke,</li>
				  <li>but never so much as smiled. The second said</li>
				  <li>this is definitely not a joke, and then his laughter crackled</li>
				  <li>through me like electrostatic—funny how that works.</li>
				  <li>When she says it’s funny she means funny</li>
				  <li>as in crazy and crazy as in this shouldn’t happen.</li>
				  <li>This shouldn’t happen as in something is off. Funny as in</li>
				  <li>off—as in, ever since a small caliber bullet chipped his spine,</li>
				  <li>your small friend walks kinda’ funny and his smile is off.</li>
			  </ul>

		<h2>the drone</h2>
			<h3>by Clint Smith</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>the drone was once a scrap of metal     the drone looks as if it might be a toy     the drone is not a </li>
				<li>toy     the drone could have been something other than a killing machine     the drone could have </li>
				<li>been a house      the drone could have been a spoon     the drone could have been a swing     the </li>
				<li>drone does not know who it is going to kill next     the drone is going to kill next     the drone has </li>
				<li>learned to disguise itself as a shard of sky     the drone’s soft hum is a disembodied echo    the drone </li>
				<li>was mistaken for a star once     the drone renders itself celestial     the drone scoffs at sovereignty</li>
				<li>the drone asks what is a border if you can fly right over it?     the drone was built by a man     the </li>
				<li>drone killed a man     & a woman     & a child     the drone killed a child     & did not see her face</li>
				<li>the drone does not see a face     the drone sees a body     & then the body is gone.</li>

		<h2>How Can Black People Write About Flowers at a Time Like This</h2>
			<h3>by Hanif Abdurraqib</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>dear reader, with our heels digging into the good </li>
				<li>mud at a swamp’s edge, you might tell me something </li>
				<li>about the dandelion & how it is not a flower itself </li>
				<li>but a plant made up of several small flowers at its crown </li>
				<li>& lord knows I have been called by what I look like </li>
				<li>more than I have been called by what I actually am &</li>
				<li>I wish to return the favor for the purpose of this </li>
				<li>exercise. which, too, is an attempt at fashioning </li>
				<li>something pretty out of seeds refusing to make anything </li>
				<li>worthwhile of their burial. size me up & skip whatever </li>
				<li>semantics arrive </li>
				<li>to the tongue first. say: that boy he look like a hollowed-out </li>
				<li>grandfather </li>
				<li>clock. he look like a million-dollar god with a two-cent </li>
				<li>heaven. like all it takes is one kiss & before morning, </li>
				<li>you could scatter his whole mind across a field.</li>
